Description: This package proposes an alternative tot he pipe from 'magrittr'. 
    It's named the same and passes all the 'magrittr' test so can easily be a drop-in
    replacement, its main advantages is that it is easy to debug and allows definition of new
    pipes. It also solves a few issues of the original pipe.
